Know that this avatar is an extension to the vanilla player model, and any changes made must be addressed and followed here if you wish to use it for yourself with as much freedom as possible

Firstly, the vanilla model has a hat layer for every body part which is .5 inflated from the base layer, this 3-layer model adds an additional hat layer at .25 inflation. In the future, when avatar options become available, you will be able to adjust the inflation of these hat layers, including the ability to have these layers underneath the base layer for further creativity (For example, 1 under layer and 1 hat layer to create a zombified version of your skin with decaying or bitten chunks)

Second, the vanilla skin png is too scrambled to keep it coherent with the new model for expansion, so I had to move the parts around to fix that. The current configuration of the skin png is now, per column = skin layer, per row = body part, at 96x96 pixel png size (In reality, the skin takes up a 96x64 space, the extra 96x32 space can be used for free edits by other people)

Third and finally, please be aware of your current vanilla skin configuration, whether it's classic or slim (4px or 3px arms), this will decide the arm size of your player model, thus you may experience limited customization.
If enough complaints are made about this fact, I'll be willing to instead make 2 avatars, one with classic arms and one with slim arms

Thank you for reading, and enjoy using the 3-Layer Skin model!
